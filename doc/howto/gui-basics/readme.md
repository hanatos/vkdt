# how to do basic things in the gui

vkdt is structured in so called *views* which are specialised front-ends
to perform specific tasks which occur in photographic workflow.

the basic cascade of ui views is:

file manager ⟷ lighttable ⟷ darkroom ⟷ graph editor

you can usually walk the arrows by key accel (enter/escape) or gamepad
(`x`/`o`). the way from darkroom to graph editor is special, because you will
not technically leave darkroom mode. the default hotkey from darkroom to
graph editor is `ctrl-n`. more precisely:

* file manager → lighttable: press enter to open the folder which has keyboard focus,
  press escape (or caps lock) to return to lighttable without changing folders
* lighttable → darkroom: press enter to open the most recently selected image in darkroom mode
* darkroom → graph editor: the default hotkey is `ctrl-n`
* darkroom ← graph editor: press escape (or caps lock)
* lighttable ← darkroom: press escape (or caps lock)
* graph editor ← lighttable: press escape (or caps lock)

in general, you can export your work but don't have to save it.

the processing history `.cfg` is saved when you exit darkroom mode or switch to
the next image (backspace/space or L1/R1).

labels and ratings `vkdt.db` are saved when you switch folder or exit vkdt.

the positions of the 2D node graph layout are saved to disk when you exit
the graph editor view.

## file manager

[![file manager](files.jpg)](files.jpg)

this is a basic file manager which allows you to navigate to folders and
to mount external drives and import images from them. import here means the
images will be physically copied to a folder on your hardrive. there is no
database backend that ingests the images, you can use any other tool to copy
the data from SD/CF/whathaveyou card too.

## lighttable

[![lighttable](lighttable.jpg)](lighttable.jpg)

in this view you can look at a folder of images. you can do basic sorting and
filtering (see widgets in the right panel). the images listed in one lighttable
session always correspond directly to a folder on disk. collections formed by
tags are symlinks in a folder in `~/.config/vkdt/tags/`.
in particular this means there is no obscure database that holds references
to your images and needs to be synchronised.
you can copy/paste edit history between images and export a selection here.

## darkroom

[![darkroom](darkroom.jpg)](darkroom.jpg)
[![darkroom fullscreen](darkroom-fs.jpg)](darkroom-fs.jpg)

this view allows you to edit the image. it is focussed on changing parameters of
the modules. there is a customisable *favourites* tab which allows you to access
frequently required parameters quickly without searching the whole lot.

press `tab` for a fullscreen mode that only shows the image (bottom), not the
controls in the right panel. press `ctrl-h` (default hotkey) to show the edit
history panel on the left which also allows you to roll back changes.

the *pipeline config* tab lets you do limited changes to the graph
configuration by adding or moving around modules.


## graph editor

[![graph editor](node-editor.jpg)](node-editor.jpg)

for complex editing graphs it is useful to view them in a more generous 2D
layout. the graph editor offers most screen real estate to the node graph and,
as a trade off, only shows small images in the right panel.
this view does not provide means to change parameters of the module, it is
only useful to create and visualise the graph structure.

this is mostly useful for slightly more complex graphs:

[![graph editor 2](node-editor2.jpg)](node-editor2.jpg)

basic interaction with the graph:

* drag a read (or write) pin to a write (or read) pin to connect
* drag a read pin into the void to remove a connection
* drag and drop a disconnected node on top of a link to insert the node

this last point only works if the node is *simple*, i.e. it has a clearly
defined chain of an `input` connector to an `output` connector and does not
depend on additional inputs which would be left unconnected here.

note that this view shows the *module* graph. this is already an abstraction
from the underlying *node* graph in which a single node directly corresponds
to a compute shader kernel executed on the GPU. these nodes will be constructed
internally and are not usually a concern for the user.

however, sometimes it is necessary or convenient to abstract even more and quickly
insert a whole set of modules and set a bulk of parameters. this can be
achieved by [presets](../presets/readme.md), which basically just append a
fixed list of commands to the graph `.cfg`.
you can do this in the right panel if you selected a module on the graph.

### special instance names

there are a few instance names that will trigger special
behaviour in the graph:

* `main` as the input module: this one is responsible to propagate
  image information further down the graph, such as camera maker and
  model and noise profiles.
* `main` as a display module: this will determine the output dimensions
  and will show as large image in the center part of darkroom mode.
* `hist` as a display module: this will show as the histogram view
  in darkroom mode and the graph editor.
* `view0` and `view1` as display modules: these will be shown in the
  gui as additional images. only `view0` in darkroom mode and both in
  the graph editor.
* `dspy` as display module: this is a special display that will
  automatically and temporarily be created and connected to the
  currently active (last expanded) module, if it has a `dspy` output.
  you can see it for instance in the `filmcurv` module.




## general remarks

### rate, label, tag

colour labels `f1`-`f5`

star ratings `1`-`5`

tag `ctrl-t`

these key accels work in both lighttable mode (on the whole selection) and in
darkroom mode (only on the single edited image).

### hotkeys

can be customised for each view separately in the gui via `settings`→
`hotkeys`. some keys are special and not in the hotkey system.

`f11` goes full screen

`ctrl+x` quits the application
