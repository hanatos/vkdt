# coltgt: colour target printing a few patches for display colour management

this module outputs the ColorChecker24 patches in bt2020, plus an additional
row with fully saturated bt2020 primaries as well as the mixed coordinates for
magenta, yellow, and cyan.

this can be useful in conjunction with say argyll's spotread to verify a
display colour management setup.
