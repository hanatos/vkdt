# o-vid: write out video files

this export module uses ffmpeg's libavcodec/libavformat to write encoded video files directly.
it supports 8-bit h264 and 10-bit prores codecs with audio.

you can select it as export option in the gui or from the cli:
```
 vkdt-cli -g /path/to/mlv-sidecar.cfg --format o-vid
```
note that the sidecar here can be the one you've been using in the gui,
i.e. the autogenerated one if you point `vkdt` to the folder or file
will work. the `cli` will append the necessary processing chain to the graph.

one of the few ways of replaying a prores video with perceptual quantiser (PQ) or hybrid log-gamma (HLG) curves
seems to be something like
```
 ffplay test_0000.mov -vf zscale=transferin=arib-std-b67:transfer=bt709:rangein=tv:range=pc:primariesin=2020:primaries=709
```

## connectors

* `input` the sink to read the raw pixel data

## parameters

* `filename` the output filename to write the stream to
* `profile` the encoding quality preset
* `quality` affects the bitrate
* `colour` chroma subsampling: 422 or 4444, both 10 bits
