this is based on a simulation detailed in the paper

Approximations of Physarum Transport Networks,**

it is also possible to connect a `mask` channel for
interesting effects:

## parameters

* `back` the parameter space point index for the background
* `cursor` the parameter space point index for the cursor area
* `colour` which colour scheme to use
* `wave` interactive simulation allows to fire waves through the particle system

## connectors

* `output` the rendered image based on coloured particle locations
* `mask` optional: input a grey scale image to modulate the pheromone trails
