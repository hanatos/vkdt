# output nothing

this is `/dev/null` for a `vkdt` graph. this can be useful to
make sure the branch is actually evaluated even if the buffer
should not be displayed or written to disk. one example setting
is the combination with `vkdt-fit` for parameter optimisation.

## connectors

* `input` : this will accept input in any format, it's not picky.
